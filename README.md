## Video Chopper Script

I'm just using this to chop up videos. It's super simple to use. Put in your preferred video file in the link video path, and it'll chop it up into **8** videos for now

### What are the requirements?
- Python 3.8 or higher
- ffmpeg
- yt-dlp

## Future Plans
- Simple, in-terminal places to fix the number of clips
- Also fix the in-terminal ability to just put your link in
